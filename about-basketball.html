        <h2>What is Basketball?</h2>
        <main>
            <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.</p>
            <p>Basketball is played over a 82 game season and is split into two confrencences, the East and the West. Only the top 8 teams in each division make it to the playoffs where the 8 teams face off against each other in a best of 4 matchup. The 4 teams remaing face off against each other until there is only 2 teams remaing. The final 2 teams play a best of 4 where the winner goes to the NBA Finals where they face the winner of the other divison</p>
