    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I've lived in Renton, Washington my whole life and I currently attend Hazen High School. I would consider myself a tech enthusiast as I have made code and built robots and I am familiar with Python and JavaScript. My main hobbies are playing sports such as basketball and soccer and running. One thing I want to take away from this class is the ability to look at a piece of code and be able to visualize and understand what the code is saying. Other than sports I love playing video games and reading.</p>
